# Asteroids-Style Space Game (C++)

A console-based arcade shooter inspired by *Asteroids*, built in C++ using ASCII characters.  
Developed as the final project for the *Object-Oriented Programming* course (2025).

## Features
- ASCII-based graphics for ships and projectiles.
- Object instantiation for multiple enemies and bullets.
- Inheritance and abstract classes for flexible design.
- Method overriding for custom game behaviors.

## Technologies
- C++
- Visual Studio

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Compile and run in console.

## Learning Outcomes
- Implemented object-oriented principles (inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction).
- Designed a simple game loop and collision system.
- Practiced structuring larger codebases with multiple classes.
